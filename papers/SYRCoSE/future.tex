\section{Future Work}

There are several directions for future work. 

First, we plan to apply our library to a wider range of problems. 
We are going to develop a mechanised semantics of some long-established
languages used to model concurrency, in particular,
the calculus of communicating systems~(CCS)~\cite{Milner:80} and 
$\pi$-calculus~\cite{Milner:99}.      
We also plan to continue our work on 
expressing various relaxed models 
of shared memory~\cite{Lahav-al:POPL16, Lahav-al:PLDI17, Podkopaev-al:POPL19}
in terms of event structures.  

Second, we want to cover other classes of event structures in our library, 
in particular, bundle~\cite{Langerak:91}, flow~\cite{Boudol-Castellani:1991},
and stable~\cite{Winskel:82, Winskel:86} event structures.
We plan to use them to develop mechanised \emph{denotational} semantics 
of concurrent languages and relaxed shared memory models~\cite{Dodds-al:ESOP18}.  

Finally, we plan to mechanise in \coq classical results 
that connect various classes of event structures%  
~\cite{Nielsen-al:1981, Boudol-Castellani:1991}. 
It would allow us to easily establish the connection between operational and denotational 
semantics of concurrent languages.
