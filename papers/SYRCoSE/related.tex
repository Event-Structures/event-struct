\section{Related Work}

Event structures were introduced by Winskel to study the semantics of 
calculus of communicating systems~\cite{Winskel:82}. 
Several modification of event structures~\cite{Langerak:91, Boudol-Castellani:1991}
were later proposed to tackle similar problems.  
To the best of our knowledge, there were no attempts 
to mechanize the classical theory of event structures 
in proof assistants. 
 
More recently event structures were applied 
in the context of relaxed memory models~%
\cite{Jeffrey-Riely:LICS16, PichonPharabod-Sewell:POPL16, Chakraborty-Vafeiadis:POPL19, Moiseenko-al:ECOOP20}.
Among this line of work, we are aware of only one paper~\cite{Moiseenko-al:ECOOP20}
that was accompanied with the mechanization in a proof assistant. 
The authors formalized \weakestmo~\cite{Chakraborty-Vafeiadis:POPL19} 
memory memory model in \coq. However, this memory model uses 
custom variant of event structures, that does not 
obey axioms of any conventional class of 
event structures~\cite{Winskel:82, Langerak:91, Boudol-Castellani:1991}. 
This fact makes it harder to reuse and adapt it 
for other applications of the theory.
